# DVWA-SQLi-Nikto-Project

This is a hands-on ethical hacking project where I set up a vulnerable environment using **DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)** and performed vulnerability scans using **SQLMap** and **Nikto**.

---

## üîß Lab Setup

- **Environment**: VirtualBox with 2 VMs (Attacker & Victim)
- **Victim Machine**: DVWA hosted on Apache2 & MariaDB (Linux Debian)
- **Attacker Machine**: Kali Linux

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools Used

- **DVWA**: Web application designed for testing web vulnerabilities
- **Nikto**: Web server scanner to detect insecure files and configurations
- **SQLMap**: Automated tool for detecting and exploiting SQL Injection vulnerabilities

---

## üîç What I Did

1. Set up and configured DVWA on the victim VM.
2. Scanned the web server with **Nikto** to detect:
   - Missing headers (e.g., X-Frame-Options)
   - Insecure HTTP methods
3. Used **SQLMap** to exploit SQLi on the `id` parameter:
   - Detected Boolean-based & Time-based SQL Injection
   - Identified backend DBMS: MySQL (MariaDB fork)
